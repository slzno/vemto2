# Welcome to Vemto ༄

[Vemto](https://vemto.app) is a desktop application focused on generating [Laravel](https://laravel.com) code, with several important features such as: editing and synchronizing the data schema (tables and models), generating migrations, models, factories, seeders, CRUD, API, and much more. 

It also features an intelligent Schema editor that automatically creates tables and columns for relationships and detects the correct type of table columns.

I'm delighted to announce that Vemto is now a fully open-source project, published under the MIT license.

A few months ago, I (Tiago Rodrigues, creator of Vemto), [wrote a blog post explaining](https://vemto.app/blog/the-future-of-vemto) in detail why Vemto would become open-source.

At the time, I wasn't sure which license to use, but after talking to countless users and customers, I ended up opting for the MIT license.

It took me a while to prepare this repository, for personal reasons, but I finally managed to increase the number of tests to over 400, covering at least the most critical parts of the application, and I will continue adding more tests overtime.

I also managed to finish writing much of the [internal development documentation](/docs/index.md).

I hope you enjoy it, and if you have any questions, please email me at contact@vemto.app.

# How to install

I recommend using yarn to compile Vemto. So, the first step is to install all the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

After that, install PHP Box (used to compile the PHP components):

```
composer global require humbug/box
```

Make sure to add Composer's /bin directory to your PATH so you can run Box globally (this is necessary to compile Vemto).

After that, access each of the PHP tools in src/php/apps and run the command:

```
composer install
```

inside their directories.

NOTE: It would be nice to automate this third step when running the development environment or when compiling the application in the future.

Finally, run Vemto in development mode with:

```
yarn dev:fast
```

## How to contribute?

Currently, you can contribute in several ways.

- Writing tests for classes that don't yet have them.
- Fixing bugs you find.
- Resolving open issues.
- Improving our [docs](https://github.com/VemtoOrg/vemto-docs)
- Adding support for improvements like Filament 4, the new Laravel 12+ FrontEnd templates, etc.
- If you have ideas for new features, please open a discussion here so we can discuss them.

The idea is that Vemto's next steps will focus on things like:

- Writing documentation on how to use Vemto. Currently, we only have v1 documentation on the website.
- Fixing most of the bugs, making it work with the vast majority of Laravel projects.
- Implementing plugin support, as was the case in v1.
- Adding support for more AI features, like generating a schema from a text description, etc.
- Focusing on what Vemto is best at: the Schema Editor.

# License

Vemto's source code is licensed under the MIT license. 

# Do I still need a license key?

Some features are only accessible to license keys holders, such as:

- Ready-made builds
- Auto-updates
- Features that use Vemto's servers to function (such as AI, etc.)

> **However, license keys sales are currently paused, and only current license holders can access them.**

If you have any questions, please contact me on **contact@vemto.app**.

# What does Vemto mean?

The word Vemto comes from my native language (Portuguese), from the original Vento, which means wind. I named the software this way because of its main objective, which has always been speed in the development of Laravel applications.
